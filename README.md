# Hello Everyone
This project includes some studies on data science with Python. I did my studies using the Abalone dataset.

## What do you need?
You must install the following libraries.
+ Scikit-learn
+ Pandas
+ Numpy
+ Matplotlib

## What's in the project?
+ Finding minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation values of all features and printing them on the screen.
+ Plotting scatter charts for these attributes and saving them as png.
  + Length vs. Diameter
  + Height vs. Whole weight
  + Shucked weight vs. Viscera weight
  + Shell weight vs. Rings
+ Creation of a decision tree for classification.
  + All attributes were used when creating a decision tree.
  + 80% of the data were randomly selected for education. The remainder was used for testing.
  + Confusion matrix printed.
  + Precision and recall criteria were printed.
  + The generated decision tree was graphically drawn, displayed, and saved as a file in png.
